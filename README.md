  # FBF Discord Buddy

  A discord app that helps with random tasks in the FBF discord!

  ## Architecture

This application uses a microservices architecture:

```
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Discord Bot │ ◀─▶ │   Backend/API/DB        │
└─────────────┘      └─────────────────────────┘
```

- **Discord Bot Service** (`services/discord-bot/`): Handles Discord interactions and commands
- **Backend Service** (`services/backend/`): Manages API endpoints, webhooks, and database operations

See [services/README.md](services/README.md) for more details on running and developing the services.
