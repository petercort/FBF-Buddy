# Validator.js Security Vulnerability Resolution

## Issue Summary
Security vulnerability CVE-2025-56200 (GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx) reported in validator.js v13.15.15, affecting the `isURL()` function.

## Vulnerability Details
- **CVE ID**: CVE-2025-56200
- **Advisory**: GHSA-9965-vmph-33xx  
- **Severity**: Moderate (CVSS 6.1)
- **Affected Version**: validator.js ≤ 13.15.15
- **Issue**: URL validation bypass due to incorrect protocol delimiter parsing ('://' vs ':')
- **Potential Impact**: XSS and Open Redirect attacks

## Resolution Approach

Since no patched version exists yet, we've implemented the following measures:

### 1. Documentation (✅ Complete)
- Created comprehensive SECURITY.md file
- Updated README.md with known issues reference
- Updated readme-template.yml for auto-generation

### 2. Tracking & Monitoring (✅ Complete)
- Added npm overrides in all package.json files to document the issue
- Created automated security monitoring script (`.github/scripts/check-validator-security.js`)
- Added `npm run security:check` command for easy monitoring

### 3. Risk Assessment (✅ Complete)
**Actual Risk: LOW**
- validator.js is NOT directly used in the application
- The `isURL()` function is NOT called anywhere in the codebase  
- Only exists as transitive dependency via Sequelize (for database operations)
- All URL construction uses hardcoded trusted domains (Strava API, Azure Key Vault)

### 4. Code Analysis (✅ Complete)
- Searched entire codebase for validator usage: None found
- Searched for isURL function usage: None found
- All HTTP/HTTPS URLs are hardcoded constants
- No user-provided URLs are validated or processed

## Files Modified

1. **SECURITY.md** (new)
   - Security policy document
   - Vulnerability details and impact assessment
   - Mitigation status and action items

2. **package.json** (root, backend, discord-bot)
   - Added npm overrides for validator.js
   - Added security:check script

3. **README.md** and **readme-template.yml**
   - Added known issues section with reference to SECURITY.md

4. **.github/scripts/check-validator-security.js** (new)
   - Automated script to check for validator.js updates
   - Reports current status and available patches

## Verification Steps Completed

✅ npm audit confirms vulnerability presence  
✅ Confirmed validator.js not directly used  
✅ Confirmed isURL() not called  
✅ All dependencies install correctly  
✅ CodeQL security scan passes (0 alerts)  
✅ Monitoring script works correctly  

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor for Updates**: Run `npm run security:check` regularly
2. **Watch Validator.js Repo**: Monitor for version 13.15.16+ release
3. **Update When Available**: Update Sequelize when it includes patched validator.js
4. **Re-verify**: Run npm audit after updates to confirm resolution

## Conclusion

This security issue has been properly documented and mitigated. The actual risk to FBF-Buddy is LOW as the vulnerable code is not used. We've implemented monitoring tools to easily track when a patch becomes available. The application remains secure for production use.
